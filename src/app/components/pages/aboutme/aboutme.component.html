      <img [src]="'assets/images/fullbodyshot.png'" alt="Mariel sitting in a bookstore" id="marielsitting">
      <p>My name is Mariel Martinez. I go by Mares. I just graduated with a Computer Programmer Diploma from Sheridan College, and also have a Bachelorâ€™s of Business Administration (BBA) from Schulich at York University. Before coming to Sheridan, I worked in the sales department at Trend Hunter, a market research firm in Toronto. There, I worked with executives at Fortune 500 companies to accelerate their innovation process using Trend Hunter's consumer insights platform.</p>
      <p>Working at Trend Hunter sparked my passion for innovation. I decided to go back to school because I want to
        learn how to build the future, instead of telling other people about it. I feel that my experience working with clients in sales will give me a unique perspective as a developer.</p>
